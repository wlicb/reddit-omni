Try being an LGBT or atheist youth in a rural area in the 1970s.   There was no one to talk to.  Social media let you connect with others like you, to find community, support, affirmation.   Talking to someone online is still *talking to someone*.\n\nAll the people I know who sweepingly consider social media isolating either grew up in cities, or were already part of a dominant majority, so they never felt isolated without it.",

I.e. LGBT people have a more difficult social baseline (especially a few decades ago) so a subpar social experience is often an improvement.\n\nTo add to your point though, I'm in the dominant social majority but had pretty bad social skills when I was young in the early 2000s (possibly some undiagnosed neurodivergence), and the Internet overall was definitely helpful for finding that affirmation among people who felt similarly alienated. \n\nAs I got older though and found my people IRL, I started to recognize that social media wasn't enough to address that loneliness compared to in person. And often was doing more harm than good (especially with Instagram, Facebook, and Snapchat in my case).\n\nReddit is the last platform I use regularly, because aside from knowledge and entertainment it offers a lot of interesting discussion, so maybe this point should be platform specific.",

In this comment, for those interested, here\u2019s the link to the peer reviewed journal article:  \n\nhttps://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa2408259\n\nResults\n\nAmong 73,838 adults (mean [\u00b1SD] age, 65\u00b19.8 years), a total of 13,802 (18.7%) died during a median follow-up of 10 years. Across all participants, greater wealth was associated with lower mortality, with adjusted hazard ratios for death (quartile 2, 3, or 4 vs. quartile 1) of 0.80 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.76 to 0.83), 0.68 (95% CI, 0.65 to 0.71), and 0.60 (95% CI, 0.57 to 0.63), respectively. The gap in survival between the top and bottom wealth quartiles was wider in the United States than in Europe. Survival among the participants in the top wealth quartiles in northern and western Europe and southern Europe appeared to be higher than that among the wealthiest Americans. Survival in the wealthiest U.S. quartile appeared to be similar to that in the poorest quartile in northern and western Europe.\n\nConclusions\n\nIn cohort studies conducted in the United States and Europe, greater wealth was associated with lower mortality, and the association between wealth and mortality appeared to be more pronounced in the United States than in Europe.\n\nFrom the linked article: \n\nEven the richest Americans face shorter lifespans than their European counterparts, study finds\n\nA study by researchers at the Brown University School of Public Health found that Americans have poorer survival rates than Europeans across all wealth levels and detailed factors driving the disparity.\n\nComparing wealth and survival rates in the U.S. with those in Europe, researchers found that over a 10-year period, Americans across all wealth levels were more likely to die than their European counterparts.\n\nThe findings were detailed in a new study in the New England Journal of Medicine by a team led by researchers at the Brown University School of Public Health. \n\nThe analysis compared data from more than 73,000 adults in the U.S. and different regions of Europe who were age 50 to 85 in 2010 to determine how wealth affects a person\u2019s chances of dying. The results revealed that people with more wealth tend to live longer than those with less wealth, especially in the U.S., where the gap between the rich and poor is much larger than in Europe.\n\nComparison data also showed that at every wealth level in the U.S., mortality rates were higher than those in the parts of Europe the researchers studied. The nation\u2019s wealthiest Americans have shorter lifespans on average than the wealthiest Europeans; in some cases, the wealthiest Americans have survival rates on par with the poorest Europeans in western parts of Europe such as Germany, France and the Netherlands.",

Walking on it is almost like walking on a trampoline. It's probably not good for the environment. It's definitely possible that it's contributing to the micro plastics issue we're having. But it is safe for the kids to fall on.\n\nOne of the playgrounds that has this stuff is the playground next to the elementary school that I went to. Back when I went there it had wood chips. They were stacked tall and they were replaced every year (I live in a weird place. The county was the second wealthiest county in the country back then, while also having a large population of poor people. So I was a poor kid going to a really nice public school. Anyway.) So they had the appropriate amount of wood chips and they replaced them as they should, but they were still dangerous. Wood chips are jagged pieces of wood. They hurt to fall on. They penetrate. They are not safe. They might stop you from breaking a bone, so better then hitting concrete, but they can also puncture a kidney or a lung. And even I tiny would is almost guaranteed to get infected because they're dirty pieces of wood that kids are constantly running over.\n\nBetween the wood chips and the springy mats, they used something else for a few years. It was kinda like packing materials. The paper version of those Styrofoam popcorn pieces. Basically the hypoallergenic biodegradable stuff you put in a hamsters cage. That stuff worked just as well as wood chips for stopping impact injuries, and it stopped any penetrative injuries. But that material does not last. It's meant to just degrade into the ground. You just keep adding new on top as it goes down. One full is probably cheaper than wood chips, but over a year the paper fill was probably more expensive than the wood chips. And so wasteful.",

This would cause it to become compacted quickly in a playground setting. I personally find if left undisturbed for a few weeks and a few rainy days, the top 1-2 inches of my woodchip mulched area solidifies into an almost concrete like consistency. \n\n* Unsorted means they can have all sorts of trash mixed in, including broken glass or metal. \n\nI love arborist chips in the garden, but I'm always picking out garbage and small-medium branches that wound up in the load.",

But people with mild cognitive impairment may, consciously or not, start depending on their spouse to manage tasks that they're no longer good at.

It doesn't have to be anything excessive, but take a class, learn a language, pick up a new hobby, something.

Other ones included: BMI, reported diabetes/hypertension, depression, smoking status, genetic pre-disposition, referral source. \n\nSeems like the biggest thing missing was controlling for parental status/having kids. Some of the other comments here about longevity hypothetically should be controlled for in this study given age controls. Diagnosis bias is also acknowledged by the study authors. They say:\n\n>... it is possible that married individuals are more likely to seek a dementia evaluation and to be diagnosed at an earlier stage compared to those who are unmarried. The possibility that unmarried individuals are more likely to be delayed/missed diagnosed with dementia due to a lack of referrals from spouses raises concerns about the possibility of later-stage dementia diagnosis or undiagnosed dementia among unmarried individuals. Interestingly, however, the moderation analyses indicated that the associations were similar by age or referral source, with slightly weaker associations among individuals who were older and referred to the clinic by non-professionals, such as self, family, or friends. Furthermore, while the widowed were diagnosed at an older age and with slightly more severe symptoms compared to the other groups, the never-married and divorced did not differ from the married on the age or severity of impairment at the time of diagnosis. Overall, it is unclear why such bias (delayed diagnosis in the unmarried) would affect the findings from the NACC and no other studies. The NACC annual assessments with standardized protocols make such bias less likely compared to studies that rely on less frequent assessments or health records.",

But since it was pink and not white, my brain thought it was fine. Alfredo mixed with pesto was also fine - green sauce! So I started mixing a bit of Alfredo into my pasta sauce any time I had pasta (college cafeteria, we had a lot of pasta) and at first I just closed my eyes and pretended it wasn't getting mixed in, and then later I purposely watched and thought about it going in, and slowly changed the ratio until it was pretty much just Alfredo sauce. It took about a year, and now I've been happily eating Alfredo sauce for 15 years (after 8 years of serious aversion). \n\nNot that Alfredo is healthy or anything - but it's neat how our brains protect us from getting poisoned, and how you can retrain yourself.",

So, I had this fried sole, it tasted slightly burnt and the outside was quite charred but I thought it was fine. Unfortunately my body wasn't feeling the same. I started vomiting after an hour. After that I started expelling what looked like hell by both ends. It was like pure acid. At some point I was barely able to keep water down. I kept emptying myself for the rest of the day and it was like anything I've had before. Spent the night on the toilet, barely standing up at all and hugging a bucket. I don't remember where my parents where but my \"incredibly smart\" dad remember to check on me after not finding me in my bed and went like \"ummm.. do you need help or something?\" I summoned the strength to plead him to call a doctor or go to the pharmacy or whatever. I remember him saying a lot of very \"smart\" stuff because my mum wasn't around and he didn't know what to do. So he went and got **only** one box of medicine. I needed 2 boxes just to finally sit somewhere that wasn't the toilet. Needless to say, I've never looked at a sole in the same way, just the smell now makes my stomach churn. Someone I was in love with had also the guts to mock and bully me about it. Like I was in need to \"grow up and go on\" because \"it's not possible that everything that goes against you becomes a trauma\". I'm still upset about the whole thing. Quite clearly I should say.",

Nirvana's unplugged set was Kurt Cobain under the influence of benzodiazepines - the cognitive effects of which may have pushed him towards suicide (as they later did for Chris Cornell).  Tobacco works a bit like speed, but is far more problematic health wise, particularly if consumed as smoke particulate.    Several drugs also are mind altering but different in speed of effect or addiction risk and we treat them differently because the slower effect on neurotransmitters and thought processes.  I don't think caffeine is particularly problematic - but the line gets pushed, particularly when taken in a polysubstance fashion - either as an upper/downer cycle where you wake in the morning with caffeine and tamp down later anxiety with alcohol or where the two combined are used like red bull and vodka and older, now typically illegal, formulations of four loko.

But I would argue that most or at least a heavy proportion of them were. And similarly you can certainly pick out some traditional African meals that are potentially very unhealthy when eaten in large amounts if we're looking to pick out specific examples, like mielie pap, fufu, etc. I'd say every culture/group of cultures has historic healthy foods and historic, uh... \"comfort\" foods that should only be eaten in moderation. \n\nThe big problem in the West is that the comfort foods have been prioritized and access/availability greatly enhanced to the point that they're the MAJORITY of the diet, while the healthier foods are harder to access and more expensive. If we shift that balance back towards plenty of healthy Western meals, it'd be a lot better for us. And I suspect if we compared the staple diets of a Westerner in 1900 to the staple diets of a Westerner in 2025, we'd see very similar results regarding inflammation, immune response, etc.",

After a little bit of research online, I think that drink is probably [Mbege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mbege).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nOkra and watermelon and coffee are all originated from East Africa (*not specifically Tanzania though, which was the country mentioned in the article*). Ugali is eaten in East Africa (*including Tanzania*), it's made from corn flour being boiled in milk or water until it becomes thick and like dough, and it can be eaten with things like collard greens or beans or soups. It's similar to fufu. The two most popular meats in a traditional African diet seem to be goat and chicken, but sometimes beef and fish are eaten. East African diets tend to be more vegetable-heavy and include more dairy than West African diets which tend to be more meat-heavy.\n\n\n\n\nIndian food also influenced East African food, such as samosas and biryani and chapati and chai (*blacktea with milk and seasonings like sugar and cinnamon and ginger and cloves*) and curry (*fish curry and lentil curry and chicken curry seem to be popular*). Curry spices are also used in Jollof rice in West Africa, so I guess there is some Influence from Indian food in West Africa too. Curry is also eaten in South Africa.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nHopefully, all of this was helpful to try to understand what they probably meant by a \"*Traditional African Diet*\".",

The things they mentioned in the diets were fruits, veggies, beans, fermented things, whole grains compared to the \u201cWestern diet\u201d which consisted of bread, French fried, refined sugars etc. \n\nI thought to myself, well the average person can\u2019t be eating fast food on a daily basis cuz insinuating people have a diet of only McDonald\u2019s or BK seems a bit disingenuous. But it isn\u2019t uncommon for people to eat it more than once a week. I also thought, there are a lot of \u201chelper\u201d foods in America. Use this can of cream of whatever to make a casserole. Use knorr sidekicks to finish your meal. Have Uncle Ben\u2019s rice on hand. Lots of bacon. Lots of salty sausage and pork. Lots of pancakes and waffles and syrup. \n\nIt also makes me wonder if these diets are mostly limited to low income families and adults who can\u2019t be bothered to cook. \n\nAs a kid from an immigrant family in Canada I grew up eating bad processed food. Reese Puffs for breakfast, sandwich for lunch with fruit gushers, a juice box, 2 cookies. I mean occasionally my mom swapped in the fruit cups by Dole by that by no means is healthy either as it taste like fruits in syrup. For our after school snack we\u2019d get chicken nuggies and fries and then whatever cultural meal my mom made\n\nAs I grew up I started rebuking processed food and only loving home cooked meals by any family member. I was like teachers pet for parents who wanted their kids to eat more home food. And now as an adult I eat a ton more of my cultural food. I am not from any african diaspora but I actually want to take some recipes away in addition to my own culture for this. \n\nMy take away from this is that beans are great too lol but America and the UK drowns it in sugar so I won\u2019t be making it that way.",

Their immune cells also responded less effectively to pathogens. Meanwhile, those who switched to a traditional African diet or consumed the fermented drink showed a reduction in inflammatory markers. Some of these effects persisted even four weeks later, indicating that short-term dietary changes can have long-lasting effects.\n\nShouldn't an abstract be much more specific than this? What inflammatory proteins? What measure of immune response? What persisted?",

If it's hot outside, and I know that it can get hot even in Denmark these days, place a few fresh mint leaves on top.\n\nOh, and if you can get some Raki, or any liquor flavoured with aniseed, to have on the side, it will definitely help.",

There are inefficiencies in in human digestion (most notably inability to digest longer fiber) that are not accounted in the burn tests and calculations based on them. And even if effective calorie intake is same for two different meals, their other nutritional content and how long it takes to get trough digestion affect hunger response. Portion frequency affects total intake as much as portion size and it is much harder to stay on a diet if you are hungry all the time. \n\nWhile the walking itself doesn't burn that many calories of energy, it just happens to be so that walking uses just enough energy to put most of us into state where our bodies are most efficient at converting fat storage into usable energy. Higher energy use levels use short term storage of energy (blood sugar and lactic acid fermentation) which are recovered from digestion and lower blood sugar states (common with weight control using just diet) use muscle protein as energy source on top of the fats.\n\nModerate change in activity levels can also have a quite a significant difference in how much energy is burned or stored in passive state, like when working on desk job or sleeping.",

This sounds more like dogma than actual science. \u201cIt\u2019s in Nature therefore it\u2019s true\u201d is a fallacy, appeal to authority. \n\nMy specialization is in physics and astronomy so yeah, I\u2019m not in health and nutrition. But it is regardless very reductive for the study to call the diets of a handful of tribes \u201cthe African diet\u201d. And also the West isn\u2019t a cultural monolith especially with food culture. \n\nIs it bad to expect scientists to be more precise with their language especially in an era where there is an excess of scientific sensationalism, where the misuse of language can mislead laypeople into wrong conclusions?",

Right now it sits at the 10th spot. \n\nIf you were to compare the American diet to Canadian ones I\u2019m sure there\u2019s many similarities as well are like sibling countries. Majority of fast food places are around every corner. Our most traditional dishes for holidays are similar. Turkeys on thanksgiving and Christmas. Our white popular eats just as diverse and our cultural population eats varieties of their cultural food and Canadian food. We eat things like cereal, bacon, sausage, eggs, toast, skillet potatoes, hash, yogurt, berries, sandwiches. In Canada your diet can be anything you want it to be. Every household is different. \n\nCanada sits at the 50th spot on the obesity index\u2019s, 40 places lower than the US. Maybe the country\u2019s lower income population and lesser educated population or southern style of food which is loaded with smoked fatty meats, carbs with greens that have all the life cooked out of them might be tanking the numbers compared to the people who eat more diverse diets.\n\n\nSo then at that point we could muse that culture, rampant poverty and lower education could be those factors and canadas poorest person is better off than Americas poorest person. \n\nI mean this is by no means evidence but in my many stays in America visiting, it always felt like I was in the house that captured Hansel and Gretel. Food was never ending. Fast food was SO cheap. Like dirt cheap. And the fast food places in Canada could not compare to their American counterparts. The spicy chicken sandwich in Canada is so meh and when I had it in Florida it was so good that I had my bf take an impromptu video of me viewing for our friends back home. The food at Cheesecake Factory was godly and the portions, I could barely finish half. You could get a fast food burger for $1.50. You could get a deal for 2 for $3.00-4.00.

It does not specifically mean \"anywhere in the West\" but instead refers to a diet that is high in fat- and more specifically, saturated fats- high in sugar or simple carbohydrates, and low in fiber.  It actually does mimic the general eating patterns of a majority of Americans, if for no other reason than because fresh vegetables and produce are expensive and cooking at home is time consuming.  For many, many people who are working, raising children, and struggling to make ends meet, this is a huge barrier to access to \"healthy\" foods.\n\nIf you have never had to look at responses to food frequency questionnaires, I can see how this might seem wild and out there.  But it is not.  There are pockets in America where we see different eating patterns, but- unsurprisingly- those pockets also tend to be more affluent areas.\n\nThe Western Diet is used very commonly in nutrition studies, but that is because it is an accurate reflection of the population as a whole.\n\nTo my knowledge, there is no such similar standardized diet that falls under the umbrella term for African diet.\n\nEdit: words hard.",

                "body": "Since so many people here are taking issue with the terms \"generalizing\" diets, \"Traditional African Diet\" and \"Western Diet\", I want to explain their use as someone studying immunology and have read a fair bit of papers on connections between diet and microbiota diversity/immunity/disease. \n\n\n\nDiet and medicine has been studied for a long time and it was decades ago that we first started using the term \"Western Diet\". At the time, this diet was pretty much only found in westernized societies and consisted of highly processed foods, fast food, and sugary drinks. People weren't as health conscious back then and it was really common. So we could say that it really did refer to the diet of westerners. \n\n\n\nAs other countries also became more modernized and processed foods became more widespread, this diet began popping up in other places. So it no longer referred solely to the diet of westerners, rather the diet of a \"westernized\" society. Simultaneously, more work was done to characterize what makes this diet different from others and this term will always refer to a diet rich in refined carbs, fat, and low in fibre but scientists may also choose to add \"minor\" characteristics like high-calorie, low nutrition, etc. Most articles which use the term \"western diet\" will further define in the introduction somewhere how they are characterizing the western diet in their article. \n\n\n\nA lot of amazing work has been done looking at the impacts of this kind of diet and this term has been solidified, so it's going to continue to be used in science even though western societies are becoming more health conscious and potentially diversifying their diet (although this is actually difficult to achieve for many in certain western societies due to economic barriers). (A good review on western diet and inflammation: DOI: 10.1016/j.immuni.2019.09.020)\n\n\n\nBasically, when scientists write or read the term \"western diet\" they're not going to think: \"hmm what's the western diet now?\". Recently, I have seen some articles trying to accommodate for changes by calling it \"western-type diet\", though not sure how much that helps. Here's a well-cited review on \n\n\n\nTo add to comments which state the \"traditional African diet\" is vague, it's not in the full article behind the paywall. A quick point: It's well established that low fibre, high refined carbs/sugar diets are bad, but the point of this study was to gather data on underrepresented non-western diet (i.e., the traditional African diet), investigate what happens when you switch from a western diet to traditional African diet (and vice versa), and look at the effect of fermented drinks. \n\n\n\nHere's what the study does. First, the authors define the \"traditional African diet\" and the western diet in the introduction. \"Africa has a rich diversity of heritage diets, often rich in vegetables, fruits, legumes, grains and fermented products.  (importantly is the inclusion of fermented foods, hence one of the comparison groups wasn't a diet switch but just the addition of a traditional fermented drink). \"Western-style diets, high in calorie-dense and processed foods...\". \n\n\n\nTheir definition is directly reflected in their sampling; subjects were only included if their typical diet matched the definition above: \"Most rural dwellers in the study were from the Chagga tribe, whose heritage diet is predominantly plant-based, rich in fiber and polyphenols, and includes \u2018Mbege\u2019, a fermented banana beverage made with finger millet. \\[...\\] Questionnaires were evaluated by a nutritionist to ensure participants were adhering to either a diet typical of the Kilimanjaro region or a Western-style diet.\u00a0 \\[...\\] Only participants adhering to either a Kilimanjaro heritage-style diet or Western-style diet were further considered for participation.\".",

I'm not a small guy, but she was a former college basketball player at Oregon State so I was afraid. The doctor didn't even want to talk to her about it.\n\nI did a little research and found that less than half of all nurses that lost lawsuits for sexually assaulting patients faced any disciplinary actions on their licenses.

In the remainder their pay is at most 52c an hour. But the government takes up to 80% of this to cover their \"room and board\". \n\nIf they refuse to work they are punished. They have no rights or protections, even basic labor laws generally don't apply.\n\nIt's *possible* that things improved in this area since 2022. But given the state of the US I would be *really* surprised if it hasn't gotten worse, rather than better.\n\nEDIT: It's also a hill hardly anyone is willing to die on politically, criminals being mistreated is something that people make jokes about rather than feel bad about generally.

Their ranks include skilled personnel who would be difficult to replace, especially if legal immigration is further restricted. Many health care workers may be removed if President Trump implements plans to deport undocumented immigrants and those losing TPS status (eg, from Haiti and Venezuela). A (currently stayed) court ruling ending DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) could affect additional personnel, including some physicians and nurses.\n\nDeportations could especially compromise long-term care, where immigrants play a large role. The resulting shortages could reverberate through emergency departments and hospitals, leading to the inability to discharge patients and tying up nurses and other staff.",

My brother said when he was a junior in high school (c.2000) the health department came to his school and gave them all their second shot. If you know you haven\u2019t had a second one, just get it.

In fact, thousands turned out to get close to the flower of the world\u2019s stinkiest plant in January in Australia. It proved such a drawcard that Sydney\u2019s Royal Botanic Gardens kept the gates open until late at night to accommodate the eager fans.\n\n\u201cUsually, you have to get close to a flower to be able to smell it,\u201d said biologist Olivia Murrell. \u201cThat is not true for the corpse flower. The second you walk into its greenhouse, its smell smacks you across the face. It\u2019s very strong. The plant also heats up when it blooms, which spreads its smell farther.\u201d\n\nWhile the endangered plant is increasingly threatened by habitat destruction and climate change, biologists from Northwestern University and the Chicago Botanic Garden have [uncovered](https://academic.oup.com/aob/advance-article/doi/10.1093/aob/mcaf038/8104011) that it\u2019s facing another huge challenge for survival: Poor record keeping.\n\nThe scientists discovered this potentially fatal flaw while putting together the genetic ancestry of 1,200 corpse flowers currently living in 111 gardens and other institutions around the world. They found so many holes in the data collected on these plants that conservationists undertaking breeding programs inadvertently narrowed the genetic pool in the process. The researchers found that of the plants they studied, 24% were direct clones and 27% were the offspring from two closely related corpse flowers. As any biologist, ecologist or zoologist will tell you, this can be a death sentence for an entire species.\n\nAnd much like in the animal kingdom \u2013 yes, including in humans \u2013 inbreeding among small populations results in a suite of evolutionarily disadvantageous traits that hamper health and survival.\n\n\u201cThere are many risks associated with low genetic diversity,\u201d said Murrell, who led the study. \u201cDecreasing genetic diversity over time leads to a decrease in fitness. Generally speaking, inbred plants might not produce as much pollen or might die right after they flower. One institution reported that, possibly as a result of inbreeding, all their corpse flower offspring were albino, so they didn\u2019t survive because they didn\u2019t have chlorophyll to photosynthesize.",

With how difficult they are to raise, you're lucky to get viable seed at all, let alone a good genetic cross.\n\nI should also point out that Amorphophallus is in a much better state, from a conservation perspective, than many other exotics.

In this comment, for those interested, here\u2019s the link to the peer reviewed journal article:  \n\nhttps://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2024.0838\n\nAbstract\n\nWe study the disclosure of influencer posts on Twitter across a large set of brands based on a unique data set of over 100 million posts and a novel classification method to detect undisclosed sponsorship. Using our preferred empirical specification, we find that 96% of sponsored posts are not disclosed. This result is robust to a series of specification tests, and even a lower-bound classification still yields an undisclosed share of 82%. Despite stronger enforcement of disclosure regulations, the share of undisclosed posts decreases only slightly over time. Compared with disclosed posts, undisclosed posts tend to be associated with young brands with a large Twitter following. Using an online survey, we find that many consumers are not able to identify sponsored content without disclosure. Our findings highlight a potential need for further regulatory scrutiny and suggest that researchers studying influencers must account for undisclosed sponsored content.\n\nFrom the linked article:\n\nNew Study Finds that Over 95% of Sponsored Influencer Posts on Twitter Were Not Disclosed\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\nOver 95% of sponsored influencer posts on Twitter were not disclosed.\nInfluencer sponsorship arrangements with younger brands are less likely to be disclosed.\n\nA large number of consumers can\u2019t detect the sponsorship arrangement without disclosure.\n\nThe consumer-protection regulatory environment around undisclosed sponsorships has lagged behind.",

It's actually super cool that an explosion this big can happen in a totally different way.  I'm going to explain in a more basic sense, but it's obviously simplified.\n\nSo a White Dwarf is the corpse of a star.  After the star runs out of material in the core to fuse the gravity of the star compresses it.  It keeps compressing until it the atoms are as close as possible (more complicated but not super relevant here).  \n\nFrom here there are two factors that cause a supernova :\n\n1. So when a White Dwarf gets more matter it just keeps pushing it all together which makes it super hot.\n\n2.  A White Dwarf can't unmake itself.  Normally when a star gets more matter and begins fusing more material it expands but still stays together (this is what a Red Giant is).  \n\nSo as a white dwarf gets enough material instead of fusing slowly and expanding the fusion of material just causes the system to get even hotter which causes more fusing and etc ...  This doesn't always have to create a supernova (can create Stellar Novae), but in a situation where the system remains undisturbed until it gets hot enough for Carbon to fuse (which a huge percentage of the White Dwarf is) it all fuses at once.  So essentially an entire sun's worth of carbon fuses at the same time.  That is what creates the supernova.\n\n\nBONUS:  Since this is based on simple nuclear reactions type 1 supernovas are super consistent.  Because of that we know how much energy/brightness are in  them.  This makes them extremely useful in determining distances because we know how bright they are is a measure of distance and energy (and we know energy).",

                "body": "I\u2019ve linked to the press release in the post above. In this comment, for those interested, here\u2019s the link to the peer reviewed journal article: \n\nhttps://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-political-science/article/partisanship-and-trust-in-personal-doctors-causes-and-consequences/2EBDC084ADC9AC8DEEB5DD716FF66B15\n\nAbstract\n\nIn the first decades of the twentieth century, the gap in age-adjusted mortality rates between people living in Republican and Democratic counties expanded; people in Democratic counties started living longer. This paper argues that political partisanship poses a direct problem for ameliorating these trends: trust and adherence in one\u2019s personal doctor (including on non-COVID-19 related care) \u2013 once a non-partisan issue \u2013 now divides Democrats (more trustful) and Republicans (less trustful). We argue that this divide is largely a consequence of partisan conflict surrounding COVID-19 that spilled over and created a partisan cleavage in people\u2019s trust in their own personal doctor. We then present experimental evidence that sharing a political background with your medical provider increases willingness to seek care. The doctor-patient relationship is essential for combating some of society\u2019s most pressing problems; understanding how partisanship shapes this relationship is vital.\n\nFrom the linked article: \n\nDemocrats are more likely to trust their personal doctors and follow their doctors\u2019 advice than Republicans, new research from the University of Oregon finds.\n\nThe findings have implications for personal and public health, as well as the practice of medicine in the United States.\n\nPatients who trust their doctors are more likely to follow their doctor\u2019s guidance on everything from managing diabetes to getting regular colon screenings, which improves health, various studies have shown.\n\n\u201cThe big takeaway from our research is that after the COVID-19 pandemic, not only are the left and right divided on COVID-19 health matters, they\u2019re also divided on trust in their own doctor and following their doctor\u2019s advice about their health conditions,\u201d O\u2019Brian said. \u201cThis broader polarization about trust in medicine has trickled down to trust in your personal doctor to treat, in some cases, your chronic illnesses.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s alarming because life expectancy has stagnated in the United States and declined in the early 2020s, O\u2019Brian said.\n\nBetween 2001 and 2019, scholars also identified a growing gap in death rates between people living in Republican and Democratic-leaning counties. Residents of Democratic counties were living longer.  \n\n\u201cIf people don\u2019t trust medical institutions or health professionals, then it makes it harder to solve health problems and could potentially exacerbate them,\u201d O\u2019Brian said.\n\nNext, the researchers investigated how much a doctor\u2019s political affiliation mattered to patients. It turned out to carry a lot of weight.",

Recent research has shown that the meninges (weird layers of thick skin around the brain and spinal cord) have their own separate immune system. Those immune cells fight disease too, but a specific type of memory immune cells also appears to reduce pain. They do this by releasing cytokines - chemicals that carry a message or command to other cells. Some cytokines tell cells to make specific proteins, some cause an inflammation (swelling) response, and some turn down or turn off the inflammation response. This research showed that T-reg cells produce cytokines that tell cells to make natural opioids and demonstrated that the effects were unrelated to inflammation.",

But so far we have no solid evidence of any other creature forming actual concepts or being capable of conceptual thought or conceptual-level communication. This distinction becomes all the more apparent when you dig deeper into the many attempts to communicate with various animals and the clear boundaries/limitations of how those animals really used the perceptual-level symbols they learned.",

Two participants were recruited through the survey process, while the remaining four were identified using a snowball sampling method. Recruitment through \u201csnowballing\u201d was a passive process, where new participants contacted one of the researchers after receiving information about the study from an initial contact or through the research team using publicly available contact details to reach potential new participants.\"\n\nSnowball sampling is very convenient for researchers, but it has a strong risk of amplifying bias present in the snowball seeds.\n\nPerhaps more importantly, looking at the Results section, it seems like a bit of a fishing expedition -- there are *many* numbers presented, and one difference is picked out (percent of respondents who said science communication was not at all useful for advancing their academic career) with **no attempt to determine statistical significance** at all, much less after correcting for multiple comparisons.\n\nThe question they're hanging so much weight on (1 of 11, recall) divided 32 people into 6 buckets and ended up with a broadly similar distribution; as they note:  \n>> \"the majority (80%) did not perceive their contributions as significant for advancing their academic careers\"\n\nHowever, the one of the buckets -- \"not at all\" -- had a significant gender skew, so that's what generated the headline we're commenting on.\n\nIs it statistically significant or is it totally expected to find a gender skew in 1 of 6 buckets after dividing 19 women and 17 men into them?  That seems like an important question for the paper to answer, but searching for \"stat\" and \"sig\" in the paper to check if I'd overlooked anything, I can't find any attempt to check the statistical significance of these findings whatsoever.\n\nFor all we know, the results in the paper are statistical noise.",

A large sample may be required only for the studies with highly variable outcomes, where an estimate of the effect size with high precision is required, or when the effect size to be detected is small.\n\nThe work you've shared in this post is a classic example of a topic that these authors would likely argue requires a *large* sample size due to the highly variable outcomes possible for any survey study of personal perceptions.",

Here\u2019s relevant parts from the paper itself:\n\n>We used a mixed method nationwide online survey with both closed-ended and open-ended questions, and conducted six in-depth, semistructured interviews with scientists involved in sci-comm across Australia\n\nSo this study was an online questionnaire with 6 follow up interviews, and was largely self reported perceptions. And of that group:\n\n>The survey was completed or partially completed by 28 women (57%), 20 men (41%) and one nonbinary person.\n\nThere does seem to be a bias towards women being in this type of field, but that gap may simply be because women represent 60% of Australian undergraduate degree holders (aka maybe there isn\u2019t a gender bias of representation here).\n\n>Most respondents (76%) said that their contribution to sci-comm was acknowledged by the society (n = 19 women; n = 17 men). Out of the 32 respondents (65%) who were in academic roles, 28% (9) stated that their work has not been acknowledged academically and the majority (80%) did not perceive their contributions as significant for advancing their academic careers (see Figure 1). Notably, nearly all respondents who deemed the work \u201cnot at all\u201d valuable were women (85%).\n\nSo it seems that when interviewed, women felt like they weren\u2019t progressing their careers by doing science communication or felt under appreciated or recognized for their work while the men did not.\n\nI think the important follow up questions for this study would be \u201cwhy do women feel under appreciated while the men do not?\u201d And \u201cis there a measurable impact to career trajectory between men and women who perform science outreach or not?\u201d\n\nI\u2019ll be honest, not a huge fan of this study. A more interesting approach would have been to correlate amount of time spent doing outreach and career trajectory or earnings and then split the data sets between men and women.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if women were more negatively impacted by doing science outreach than men, but right now this study isnt telling us anything.",

Women engage in these role *depite* not seeing them as a strategy for career advancement. (Because genuinely, they aren\u2019t; tenure and promotion committees do not heavily weight these kinds of professional activities.) So the study reports on *why* women engage in these activities despite not considering them as important for their careers. The reasons given are varied, but include a desire to disseminate research findings and a sense of duty:\n\n>To summarize, while respondents were mostly positive about the impact of their sci-comm work, the majority expressed reservations about its value to their careers. Nevertheless, they identified skill improvement and personal fulfillment (43%) as the most important benefit of working in sci-comm. Other salient motivations included networking opportunities (20%), a desire to explain and promote science to the public (20%), and a sense of obligation to give back to the scientific community (4%).4",

If we're saying now that it's \"clear\" that women do the bulk of that work, that's a *dramatic* change that has occurred in less than a generation. \n\nSome might consider this evidence of progress!

But since you asked: I believe academic research needs to remove the barriers to women (and minorities) so that the people who *do* want to get into science and are capable *can.* We've made considerable progress policy-wise and even culturally, but if you think it's \\~solved\\~ and women (and minorities) don't face any additional challenges that their white, male counterparts do not, you are sorely mistaken and are either oblivious or not part of the community.\n\n>It\u2019s not \u201ceveryone\u2019s duty\u201d, it\u2019s a specific job with a specific skill set.

Any scientist who is a poor communicator to non-experts is a poor communicator by their own doing. Several scientists, both men and women, manage it. What's got our society into this pseudoscience-heralding, faux-skeptic mess is a direct result of the scientific communities' lack of prioritizing outreach. Also, I fully recognize that we already ask a lot of PIs, and that is why there needs to be systemic, ecosystem-wide support for this outreach. But we have seen how climate science has been attacked and did not respond appropriately. Now we've seen those same strategies lobbied against vaccines and the scientists who led the campaign to develop them. SciComm is an *essential* duty.",
