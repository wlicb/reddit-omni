Try being an LGBT or atheist youth in a rural area in the 1970s.   There was no one to talk to.  Social media let you connect with others like you, to find community, support, affirmation.   Talking to someone online is still *talking to someone*.\n\nAll the people I know who sweepingly consider social media isolating either grew up in cities, or were already part of a dominant majority, so they never felt isolated without it.",

I.e. LGBT people have a more difficult social baseline (especially a few decades ago) so a subpar social experience is often an improvement.\n\nTo add to your point though, I'm in the dominant social majority but had pretty bad social skills when I was young in the early 2000s (possibly some undiagnosed neurodivergence), and the Internet overall was definitely helpful for finding that affirmation among people who felt similarly alienated. \n\nAs I got older though and found my people IRL, I started to recognize that social media wasn't enough to address that loneliness compared to in person. And often was doing more harm than good (especially with Instagram, Facebook, and Snapchat in my case).\n\nReddit is the last platform I use regularly, because aside from knowledge and entertainment it offers a lot of interesting discussion, so maybe this point should be platform specific.",

In this comment, for those interested, here\u2019s the link to the peer reviewed journal article:  \n\nhttps://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa2408259\n\nResults\n\nAmong 73,838 adults (mean [\u00b1SD] age, 65\u00b19.8 years), a total of 13,802 (18.7%) died during a median follow-up of 10 years. Across all participants, greater wealth was associated with lower mortality, with adjusted hazard ratios for death (quartile 2, 3, or 4 vs. quartile 1) of 0.80 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.76 to 0.83), 0.68 (95% CI, 0.65 to 0.71), and 0.60 (95% CI, 0.57 to 0.63), respectively. The gap in survival between the top and bottom wealth quartiles was wider in the United States than in Europe. Survival among the participants in the top wealth quartiles in northern and western Europe and southern Europe appeared to be higher than that among the wealthiest Americans. Survival in the wealthiest U.S. quartile appeared to be similar to that in the poorest quartile in northern and western Europe.\n\nConclusions\n\nIn cohort studies conducted in the United States and Europe, greater wealth was associated with lower mortality, and the association between wealth and mortality appeared to be more pronounced in the United States than in Europe.\n\nFrom the linked article: \n\nEven the richest Americans face shorter lifespans than their European counterparts, study finds\n\nA study by researchers at the Brown University School of Public Health found that Americans have poorer survival rates than Europeans across all wealth levels and detailed factors driving the disparity.\n\nComparing wealth and survival rates in the U.S. with those in Europe, researchers found that over a 10-year period, Americans across all wealth levels were more likely to die than their European counterparts.\n\nThe findings were detailed in a new study in the New England Journal of Medicine by a team led by researchers at the Brown University School of Public Health. \n\nThe analysis compared data from more than 73,000 adults in the U.S. and different regions of Europe who were age 50 to 85 in 2010 to determine how wealth affects a person\u2019s chances of dying. The results revealed that people with more wealth tend to live longer than those with less wealth, especially in the U.S., where the gap between the rich and poor is much larger than in Europe.\n\nComparison data also showed that at every wealth level in the U.S., mortality rates were higher than those in the parts of Europe the researchers studied. The nation\u2019s wealthiest Americans have shorter lifespans on average than the wealthiest Europeans; in some cases, the wealthiest Americans have survival rates on par with the poorest Europeans in western parts of Europe such as Germany, France and the Netherlands.",

Walking on it is almost like walking on a trampoline. It's probably not good for the environment. It's definitely possible that it's contributing to the micro plastics issue we're having. But it is safe for the kids to fall on.\n\nOne of the playgrounds that has this stuff is the playground next to the elementary school that I went to. Back when I went there it had wood chips. They were stacked tall and they were replaced every year (I live in a weird place. The county was the second wealthiest county in the country back then, while also having a large population of poor people. So I was a poor kid going to a really nice public school. Anyway.) So they had the appropriate amount of wood chips and they replaced them as they should, but they were still dangerous. Wood chips are jagged pieces of wood. They hurt to fall on. They penetrate. They are not safe. They might stop you from breaking a bone, so better then hitting concrete, but they can also puncture a kidney or a lung. And even I tiny would is almost guaranteed to get infected because they're dirty pieces of wood that kids are constantly running over.\n\nBetween the wood chips and the springy mats, they used something else for a few years. It was kinda like packing materials. The paper version of those Styrofoam popcorn pieces. Basically the hypoallergenic biodegradable stuff you put in a hamsters cage. That stuff worked just as well as wood chips for stopping impact injuries, and it stopped any penetrative injuries. But that material does not last. It's meant to just degrade into the ground. You just keep adding new on top as it goes down. One full is probably cheaper than wood chips, but over a year the paper fill was probably more expensive than the wood chips. And so wasteful.",

This would cause it to become compacted quickly in a playground setting. I personally find if left undisturbed for a few weeks and a few rainy days, the top 1-2 inches of my woodchip mulched area solidifies into an almost concrete like consistency. \n\n* Unsorted means they can have all sorts of trash mixed in, including broken glass or metal. \n\nI love arborist chips in the garden, but I'm always picking out garbage and small-medium branches that wound up in the load.",

But people with mild cognitive impairment may, consciously or not, start depending on their spouse to manage tasks that they're no longer good at.

It doesn't have to be anything excessive, but take a class, learn a language, pick up a new hobby, something.

Other ones included: BMI, reported diabetes/hypertension, depression, smoking status, genetic pre-disposition, referral source. \n\nSeems like the biggest thing missing was controlling for parental status/having kids. Some of the other comments here about longevity hypothetically should be controlled for in this study given age controls. Diagnosis bias is also acknowledged by the study authors. They say:\n\n>... it is possible that married individuals are more likely to seek a dementia evaluation and to be diagnosed at an earlier stage compared to those who are unmarried. The possibility that unmarried individuals are more likely to be delayed/missed diagnosed with dementia due to a lack of referrals from spouses raises concerns about the possibility of later-stage dementia diagnosis or undiagnosed dementia among unmarried individuals. Interestingly, however, the moderation analyses indicated that the associations were similar by age or referral source, with slightly weaker associations among individuals who were older and referred to the clinic by non-professionals, such as self, family, or friends. Furthermore, while the widowed were diagnosed at an older age and with slightly more severe symptoms compared to the other groups, the never-married and divorced did not differ from the married on the age or severity of impairment at the time of diagnosis. Overall, it is unclear why such bias (delayed diagnosis in the unmarried) would affect the findings from the NACC and no other studies. The NACC annual assessments with standardized protocols make such bias less likely compared to studies that rely on less frequent assessments or health records.",

But since it was pink and not white, my brain thought it was fine. Alfredo mixed with pesto was also fine - green sauce! So I started mixing a bit of Alfredo into my pasta sauce any time I had pasta (college cafeteria, we had a lot of pasta) and at first I just closed my eyes and pretended it wasn't getting mixed in, and then later I purposely watched and thought about it going in, and slowly changed the ratio until it was pretty much just Alfredo sauce. It took about a year, and now I've been happily eating Alfredo sauce for 15 years (after 8 years of serious aversion). \n\nNot that Alfredo is healthy or anything - but it's neat how our brains protect us from getting poisoned, and how you can retrain yourself.",

So, I had this fried sole, it tasted slightly burnt and the outside was quite charred but I thought it was fine. Unfortunately my body wasn't feeling the same. I started vomiting after an hour. After that I started expelling what looked like hell by both ends. It was like pure acid. At some point I was barely able to keep water down. I kept emptying myself for the rest of the day and it was like anything I've had before. Spent the night on the toilet, barely standing up at all and hugging a bucket. I don't remember where my parents where but my \"incredibly smart\" dad remember to check on me after not finding me in my bed and went like \"ummm.. do you need help or something?\" I summoned the strength to plead him to call a doctor or go to the pharmacy or whatever. I remember him saying a lot of very \"smart\" stuff because my mum wasn't around and he didn't know what to do. So he went and got **only** one box of medicine. I needed 2 boxes just to finally sit somewhere that wasn't the toilet. Needless to say, I've never looked at a sole in the same way, just the smell now makes my stomach churn. Someone I was in love with had also the guts to mock and bully me about it. Like I was in need to \"grow up and go on\" because \"it's not possible that everything that goes against you becomes a trauma\". I'm still upset about the whole thing. Quite clearly I should say.",

Nirvana's unplugged set was Kurt Cobain under the influence of benzodiazepines - the cognitive effects of which may have pushed him towards suicide (as they later did for Chris Cornell).  Tobacco works a bit like speed, but is far more problematic health wise, particularly if consumed as smoke particulate.    Several drugs also are mind altering but different in speed of effect or addiction risk and we treat them differently because the slower effect on neurotransmitters and thought processes.  I don't think caffeine is particularly problematic - but the line gets pushed, particularly when taken in a polysubstance fashion - either as an upper/downer cycle where you wake in the morning with caffeine and tamp down later anxiety with alcohol or where the two combined are used like red bull and vodka and older, now typically illegal, formulations of four loko.

Majority of fast food places are around every corner. Our most traditional dishes for holidays are similar. Turkeys on thanksgiving and Christmas. Our white popular eats just as diverse and our cultural population eats varieties of their cultural food and Canadian food. We eat things like cereal, bacon, sausage, eggs, toast, skillet potatoes, hash, yogurt, berries, sandwiches. In Canada your diet can be anything you want it to be. Every household is different. \n\nCanada sits at the 50th spot on the obesity index\u2019s, 40 places lower than the US. Maybe the country\u2019s lower income population and lesser educated population or southern style of food which is loaded with smoked fatty meats, carbs with greens that have all the life cooked out of them might be tanking the numbers compared to the people who eat more diverse diets.\n\n\nSo then at that point we could muse that culture, rampant poverty and lower education could be those factors and canadas poorest person is better off than Americas poorest person. \n\nI mean this is by no means evidence but in my many stays in America visiting, it always felt like I was in the house that captured Hansel and Gretel.

It does not specifically mean \"anywhere in the West\" but instead refers to a diet that is high in fat- and more specifically, saturated fats- high in sugar or simple carbohydrates, and low in fiber.  It actually does mimic the general eating patterns of a majority of Americans, if for no other reason than because fresh vegetables and produce are expensive and cooking at home is time consuming.  For many, many people who are working, raising children, and struggling to make ends meet, this is a huge barrier to access to \"healthy\" foods.\n\nIf you have never had to look at responses to food frequency questionnaires, I can see how this might seem wild and out there.  But it is not.  There are pockets in America where we see different eating patterns, but- unsurprisingly- those pockets also tend to be more affluent areas.\n\nThe Western Diet is used very commonly in nutrition studies, but that is because it is an accurate reflection of the population as a whole.\n\nTo my knowledge, there is no such similar standardized diet that falls under the umbrella term for African diet.\n\nEdit: words hard.",

I'm not a small guy, but she was a former college basketball player at Oregon State so I was afraid. The doctor didn't even want to talk to her about it.\n\nI did a little research and found that less than half of all nurses that lost lawsuits for sexually assaulting patients faced any disciplinary actions on their licenses.

In the remainder their pay is at most 52c an hour. But the government takes up to 80% of this to cover their \"room and board\". \n\nIf they refuse to work they are punished. They have no rights or protections, even basic labor laws generally don't apply.\n\nIt's *possible* that things improved in this area since 2022. But given the state of the US I would be *really* surprised if it hasn't gotten worse, rather than better.\n\nEDIT: It's also a hill hardly anyone is willing to die on politically, criminals being mistreated is something that people make jokes about rather than feel bad about generally.

Their ranks include skilled personnel who would be difficult to replace, especially if legal immigration is further restricted. Many health care workers may be removed if President Trump implements plans to deport undocumented immigrants and those losing TPS status (eg, from Haiti and Venezuela). A (currently stayed) court ruling ending DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) could affect additional personnel, including some physicians and nurses.\n\nDeportations could especially compromise long-term care, where immigrants play a large role. The resulting shortages could reverberate through emergency departments and hospitals, leading to the inability to discharge patients and tying up nurses and other staff.",
