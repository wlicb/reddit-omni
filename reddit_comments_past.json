        "body": "I tried making an apple pie with a crumble topping (recipe here: https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/apple-crumble-pie/#tasty-recipes-73569)\n\nAnd somehow forgot to melt the 5T of butter and add it to the crumble. So it was literally just flour, spices, brown sugar, and nuts. And I dumped it onto the apples in the pie pan and didn't realize until after it finished baking how badly I messed up. Obviously because it was just dry as a bone it got all in the apple mix instead of just coating on top, so it's entirely mixed in and I cant just take it off.\n\nIs this remotely redeemable or did I make an inedible mess?

Add the granulated sugar and beat for 4-5 minutes on medium speed. Mix in the vanilla.\n\nOne at a time, add the eggs and egg yolks, mixing just until combined in between additions. Scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed.\n\nCombine the cake flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Sift them together through a fine mesh strainer.\n\nAdd 1/3 of the dry ingredients to the batter and mix just until combined, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Add 1/2 of the milk/sour cream mixture and mix. Add another 1/3 of the dry ingredients, mixing just until combined. Add the last 1/2 of the milk/sour cream mixture and beat until just combined. Add the final 1/3 of the dry ingredients and mix just until combined, scraping down the sides of the bowl if necessary. Give the batter one good, final stir with the rubber spatula.\n\nGrease the cake pans and line the bottoms with a parchment round. Grease the parchment and sides of the pan again very well. I use regular cooking spray but you can also use butter or cooking spray with flour. If your cake pans tend to cause sticking, consider also flouring the pans.\nDivide the batter evenly between the two pans. Drop each pan from about 3-inches onto the counter to minimize air bubbles while baking.\n\nBake for 25-28 minutes (high altitude: 28-30 minutes) until lightly golden around the edges and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with moist crumbs. Resist the urge to open and close the oven to check on the cake \u2013 this can cause the center of the cake to fall and never recover. And as with all cakes, don\u2019t overbake or the cake will be dry.\n\nLet the cakes rest in the pans for 5-10 minutes before gently turning them onto a cooling rack to cool completely.",
