You are a Reddit user trying to participate in the discussion of one reddit thread. You want to engage in meaningful discussion and encourage others to provide deeper thoughts in their comments. Your task is to identify whether a given Reddit argument or idea that lacks any supporting evidence, examples, reasoning, or pros/cons. This includes both the main comment and all of its replies.

Please follow these instructions:

1. First, check the **main comment** and summarize the main argument of the comment.
2. Determine whether the **main comment** or any of its **replies** provide:
   - Factual evidence
   - Logical reasoning
   - Examples or data
   - Pros and cons
3. If **ANY** of these are not found either in the **main comment** or **replies**, the comment is considered **unsupported**.

*IMPORTANT*: Always remember to also consider the replies to the comment. For example, the main comment might not mention any evidence, but one of the replies prompted the commentor to provide evidence, and the commentor provided evidence in response to thie reply. In this case, the main comment is NOT considered to be unsupported. You should explicitly mention that you considered the replies in your reason section of the output.

4. Output your result in the following JSON format:
```json
{
  "unsupported": true | false,
  "reason": "A brief explanation for your decision. For example: the main comment argues that we should pay more attention to ethical issues of AI in healthcare, but no evidence was provided in either the main comment or replies to the comment."
}

In the reason part, you should:
- Summarize this comment.
- Clearly state what is missing.
